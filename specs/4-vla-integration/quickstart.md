# Quickstart Guide: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Module

## Overview
This quickstart guide provides a high-level introduction to the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) module, designed for AI engineers and robotics developers familiar with ROS 2, simulation, and navigation concepts.

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of ROS 2 fundamentals
- Knowledge from previous modules: simulation and navigation concepts
- Familiarity with robotics terminology
- Basic understanding of AI and machine learning concepts

## Getting Started

### 1. Chapter 1: Voice-to-Action Pipelines
**Focus**: Speech-to-text using OpenAI Whisper and mapping voice commands to robot intents

**Key Learning Points**:
- Understand how OpenAI Whisper works in robotics context
- Learn how voice commands are mapped to structured robot actions
- Apply voice-to-action pipeline concepts

**Expected Outcome**: Ability to explain how voice input becomes structured actions using OpenAI Whisper.

### 2. Chapter 2: Cognitive Planning with LLMs
**Focus**: Translating natural language tasks into ROS 2 action sequences and task decomposition logic

**Key Learning Points**:
- Understand how LLMs enable cognitive planning for robotics
- Learn how natural language tasks translate to ROS 2 action sequences
- Apply task decomposition and planning logic

**Expected Outcome**: Ability to explain LLM-based planning for robotics and how natural language tasks are converted to executable actions.

### 3. Chapter 3: Capstone — The Autonomous Humanoid
**Focus**: End-to-end system flow integrating navigation, perception, and manipulation

**Key Learning Points**:
- Understand the complete end-to-end autonomous humanoid system flow
- Learn how navigation, perception, and manipulation work together
- Apply complete system integration concepts

**Expected Outcome**: Ability to explain how all modules integrate into a single autonomous system.

## Recommended Learning Path
1. Start with Chapter 1 to build foundational knowledge of voice interfaces
2. Proceed to Chapter 2 to understand cognitive planning with LLMs
3. Complete with Chapter 3 to master end-to-end system integration

## Integration with Other Modules
- Builds upon: ROS 2, simulation, and navigation modules
- Leads to: Complete autonomous humanoid system implementation
