# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Welcome to the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) module! This module explains how large language models integrate with robotics systems to perceive, reason, and act, enabling humanoid robots to convert natural language and vision inputs into physical actions.

## Overview

This module covers three core areas of VLA integration:

1. **Voice-to-Action Pipelines** - Speech-to-text using OpenAI Whisper and mapping voice commands to robot intents
2. **Cognitive Planning with LLMs** - Translating natural language tasks into ROS 2 action sequences and task decomposition logic
3. **Capstone — The Autonomous Humanoid** - End-to-end system flow integrating navigation, perception, and manipulation

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will understand:
- How voice input becomes structured actions using OpenAI Whisper
- LLM-based planning for robotics and how natural language tasks are converted to executable actions
- The complete end-to-end autonomous humanoid system flow with navigation, perception, and manipulation
- How all modules integrate into a single autonomous system

## Prerequisites

This module assumes familiarity with:
- ROS 2 fundamentals
- Basic understanding of AI and machine learning concepts
- Knowledge from previous modules: simulation and navigation concepts
- Robotics terminology

## Module Structure

- [Chapter 1: Voice-to-Action Pipelines](./4.1-chapter-1-voice-to-action-pipelines.md)
- [Chapter 2: Cognitive Planning with LLMs](./4.2-chapter-2-cognitive-planning-with-llms.md)
- [Chapter 3: Capstone — The Autonomous Humanoid](./4.3-chapter-3-capstone-autonomous-humanoid.md)

## Integration

This module builds upon the ROS 2, simulation, and navigation modules and provides the capstone integration for the entire robotics education series. It demonstrates how voice interfaces, cognitive planning, and system integration work together to create fully autonomous humanoid robots.

## Target Audience

AI engineers and robotics developers familiar with ROS 2, simulation, and navigation concepts.
