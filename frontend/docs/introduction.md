# Introduction to AI-Native Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on AI-Native Robotics, where artificial intelligence meets the cutting edge of robotic systems. This book explores the convergence of AI agents, ROS 2 communication systems, and humanoid robotics in the modern era.

## About This Book

This book is designed to bridge the gap between traditional robotics and the new era of AI-driven robotic systems. As robotics technology evolves, the integration of artificial intelligence has become essential for creating more autonomous, adaptable, and intelligent machines.

The content combines theoretical foundations with practical implementation examples, providing you with both the knowledge and tools needed to develop next-generation robotic systems.

## What You'll Learn

- **Module 1**: Robotic Communication Systems - Understanding ROS 2 fundamentals, Python agents with rclpy, and humanoid URDF modeling
- **Module 2**: Digital Twin Simulation - Physics simulation with Gazebo, environment design in Unity, and sensor simulation
- **Module 3**: The AI-Robot Brain - NVIDIA Isaac Sim fundamentals, Isaac ROS perception, and navigation with Nav2 for humanoids
- **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) - Voice-to-action pipelines, cognitive planning with LLMs, and capstone autonomous humanoid systems

## How to Navigate

This book is structured as a comprehensive guide that can be approached in multiple ways:

- **Sequential Reading**: Follow the chapters in order for a complete understanding
- **Modular Approach**: Each chapter is designed to be self-contained
- **Hands-on Practice**: All examples include practical implementation code
- **Reference Guide**: Use as a reference for specific topics and techniques
