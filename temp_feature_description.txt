AI/Spec-Driven Book — Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) Target audience: Beginner/intermediate robotics and simulation learners. Focus: Physics-based simulation in Gazebo, high-fidelity visualization in Unity, and virtual sensor simulation (LiDAR, Depth, IMU). Chapters: 1. **Digital Twin Fundamentals** — What a digital twin is, why simulations matter, Gazebo vs Unity roles. 2. **Physics & Environment Simulation** — Gravity, collisions, materials, worlds in Gazebo; robot movement testing. 3. **Sensors & Interaction Simulation** — Virtual LiDAR, Depth Camera, IMU pipelines; human-robot interaction in Unity. Success criteria: * Accurate simulation concepts aligned with Gazebo & Unity docs. * Clear explanations with simple diagrams (sensor rays, physics flow). * Fully spec-driven for clean Docusaurus generation. Constraints: * 12–15 pages total for Module 2. * MDX format. * No plagiarism. * Avoid deep engine-level physics programming. Not building: * Full Unity C# coding tutorials. * Hardware sensor wiring guides. * Non-robotics game development topics.
