# PHR: plan-docusaurus-purple-theme

## Prompt Text

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response Text

Completed planning phase for Docusaurus purple theme upgrade. Created comprehensive implementation plan including:
- Technical context with technology stack and constraints
- Constitution check ensuring compliance with project principles
- Project structure defining component locations
- Research document with technical decisions and alternatives
- Data model for theme configuration and navigation structure
- Quickstart guide for development setup
- Component interface contracts

All artifacts created in specs/2-docusaurus-purple-theme/ directory following Spec-Kit Plus methodology. Plan specifically addresses the constraint of avoiding custom React contexts to prevent build errors.

## Outcome

Implementation plan is complete and ready for task breakdown phase. The plan addresses all requirements from the specification with appropriate technical approaches that maintain Docusaurus compatibility while achieving the desired purple-themed book-like reading experience.

## Evaluation

Plan successfully aligns with specification requirements and project constitution. Technical approach follows Docusaurus best practices while achieving the goals of improved purple-based theme, navigation, and book-like structure. Critical constraint of avoiding custom React contexts is respected to prevent build errors.
