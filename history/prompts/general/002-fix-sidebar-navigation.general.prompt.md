# Prompt History Record: Fix Sidebar Navigation and Broken Links

## Original Prompt
```
fix the double module 1 remove 1 time module 1
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Sidebar Navigation
- Removed the autogenerated section from sidebars.js that was causing duplicate navigation entries
- Kept only the manual category for 'Module 1: Robotic Communication Systems'
- This eliminated the "double module 1" issue mentioned in the prompt

### 2. Fixed Broken Links
- Updated the footer configuration in docusaurus.config.js to point to an existing page instead of /docs/intro
- Changed the link from '/docs/intro' to '/docs/module-1/ros2-fundamentals'
- Created a homepage at src/pages/index.md to serve as the root page

### 3. Created Homepage
- Added index.md to src/pages/ to provide a proper homepage for the site
- The homepage includes a welcome message and links to the robotics modules

## Outcome
- Fixed the duplicate "module 1" navigation issue
- Resolved all broken links in the documentation
- Successfully built the Docusaurus site without errors
- The site now has proper navigation structure without duplication

## Evaluation
The implementation successfully addressed the user's request to fix the "double module 1" issue by removing the autogenerated sidebar section that was causing duplicate navigation entries. All broken links have been fixed and the site builds successfully.
